# Decimal-to-Binary-Converter
I have written basic code for decimal to binary converter. Basically, this c program takes integer number as input and then prints binary form of that number

# Binary Converter

This repository contains a C program that takes an integer number as user input and prints its binary representation.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/SinghIsWriting/Decimal-to-Binary-Converter.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory
3. Compile the C program using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:
gcc decimal_to_binary.c -o binary_converter

4. Run the compiled program:
./binary_converter

5. The program will prompt you to enter an integer number.
6. Enter the number for which you want to obtain the binary representation.
7. The program will convert the number into binary and display the result.

## Program Details

The `binary_converter.c` file contains a program that takes an integer number as user input and converts it into its binary representation.

The user is prompted to enter an integer number. The program then uses bitwise operators and shifts to convert the number into its binary form.

The resulting binary representation is then displayed on the console.

Feel free to explore the code in the repository and modify it according to your needs.

Happy coding!
